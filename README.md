# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-With-OCR

BizCardX is a project aimed at developing a Streamlit application that enables users to extract relevant information from business cards using OCR technology. The application utilizes easyOCR, along with Python and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL, to extract and store data such as company name, card holder name, designation, contact details, and address. The extracted information is then presented in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to easily add it to a database. With a focus on scalability, maintainability, and extensibility, this project combines image processing, OCR, GUI development, and database management skills to create an efficient solution for managing business card information.

# Following Steps:

The steps involved in developing the BizCardX application are as follows:

1. Install the required packages: Begin by installing Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a suitable database management system like SQLite or MySQL.

2. Design the user interface: Create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. Use widgets such as file uploader, buttons, and text boxes to guide users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information.

3. Implement image processing and OCR: Utilize easyOCR to extract the relevant information from the uploaded business card image. Apply image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding to enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine.

4. Display the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted, present it in a clean and organized manner within the Streamlit GUI. Utilize widgets like tables, text boxes, and labels to display the extracted data effectively.

5. Implement database integration: Establish a connection to a database management system (e.g., SQLite or MySQL) and create a suitable table structure to store the extracted information. Use SQL queries to create tables, insert data, retrieve data, update records, and delete entries as required.

6. Test the application: Thoroughly test the application to ensure its functionality and reliability. Run the application locally by executing the command "streamlit run app.py" in the terminal, where "app.py" represents the name of the Streamlit application file.

7. Improve the application: Continuously enhance the application by adding new features, optimizing the code, and fixing any identified bugs. Consider implementing user authentication and authorization to enhance security.

Throughout the development process, maintain good documentation and organize the code effectively to ensure clarity and ease of maintenance.

By following these steps, you can successfully develop the BizCardX application, enabling users to upload business card images, extract relevant information, display it in the GUI, and store it in a database for efficient management.


The result is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload business card images, extract relevant information, display it in a GUI, and store it in a database
